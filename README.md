# to-do
A very simple to-do project that required that the items be stored as a single array 
of string values. The output had to include an h1 that contained the text "TO-DO:", 
written by a function called "todo." The items then had to be added to the div from a 
single function (addTodos). Doing things this way definitely helped ingrain the use loops
in me.
